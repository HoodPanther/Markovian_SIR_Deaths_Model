# Markovian_SIR_Deaths_Model
I noticed that traditional methods to predict a disease outbreak was by performing sentiment analysis on Twitter posts and Google Search terms.  Unfortunately, these methods were inadequate, as Twitter and Google is not popular in all countries. So, I created a system to model and predict outbreaks without the need for social media.  The system was able to update the probabilities of a virus from spreading from A to B in real time, and I plan to release it to the public next year.  I also used Machine Learning and Deep Learning to predict larger long-term virus trends with Google Trends, and this acted as a validator for the MSIRD model.
